I spent many months struggling with obsessions, which lead to time-consuming compulsions, stress, the frustration that started spoiling my Personal, Social and professional life From the very first session, I found Mr Aftab very easy to talk to. He allowed me to open up as and when I felt ready and talk about things which disturbed my mental health.He helped me see things in a new light and also different ways to handle obsessions. Our therapy sessions were always helpful and left me feeling very positive and confident. I would recommend him to someone feeling anxious or unsure about therapy. The experience is life-changing.!!',
